            Hackman is a 24 hour inter college open theme hackathon conducted by Department of Information Science and Engineering, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore. It is also a platform where young talented minds from various colleges in Bangalore come up with amazing ideas, code them and make a prototype. Hackman 2k18 is the third version of its type and we have conducted two very successful versions in the past two years. We expect to have 200 participants who will compete in teams where the maximum participants in a team would be 4.
            We value the participation of every member of Hackman and want all participants to have an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

        In particular, mentors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. The organizers (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
        All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience, including people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language or imagery is inappropriate for all aspects of the conference, including talks. Remember that sexist, racist or any other form of exclusionary or offensive jokes or excessive public swearing are not appropriate and will not be appreciated.
